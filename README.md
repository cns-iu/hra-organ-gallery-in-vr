Welcome to this repo! The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) Organ Gallery ([https://humanatlas.io/vr-organ-gallery](https://humanatlas.io/vr-organ-gallery)) lets the user explore 65 human organs and 800+ of tissue blocks (as of the HRA v2.1), presented in real-world size and 3D. The organ models were developed to map trillions of cells for the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://commonfund.nih.gov/hubmap), the [Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet)](https://sennetconsortium.org/), and similar efforts. 

## Organs
To download the most up to date GLB files for the organs of the HRA, please visit the [HRA 3D Reference Object Library](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library).

## Become a test user

If you would like to become a **test user**, please download the application at [https://www.meta.com/experiences/5696814507101529/](https://www.meta.com/experiences/5696814507101529/). Information for testers can be found [here](INFORMATION_FOR_TESTERS.MD). A paper describing the concept of the application is available [here](https://doi.org/10.3389/fbinf.2023.1162723).

For more information about the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) used to map tissue blocks from 800+ of donors to single reference organs (as of HRA v2.1), see the Human Reference Atlas Portal at [https://humanatlas.io/](https://humanatlas.io/).
