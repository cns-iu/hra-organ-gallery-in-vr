#### Known issues
* You need an internet connection to use the application. 
* Framerate drops occur when more than 3-4 organs are in the viewport at once
* Extreme framerate drops occur while organs are loaded (~5-10 seconds after application starts)
* Rendering issues cause lack of transparency between organs and tissue blocks 
* Jagged edges along text labels and background
* Wrongly registered tissue blocks appear to float in space when extruded
* Light sources sometimes flicker in and out
* When collapsing organs back into the body, there is a joystick value mismatch, causing the organs to partially come out again
* The mammary glands are placed close to our outside of the boundaries of the teleportable floor when fully extruded
